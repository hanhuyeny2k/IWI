# IWI

## Description
IWI is a social platform connecting people who share the same interests and hobby. User can post any open events or clubs for other people in the same community to join. It's a way to connect and meet new people.


## Inspiration
After a few months of lock-down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we  see the lack of outreach to our community. The isolation has driven people to crave more human interaction so we would want to build a web application that can connect people to people and uplift our community.
